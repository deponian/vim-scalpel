### Description

This is modified version of [scalpel](https://github.com/wincent/scalpel). I've changed logic of ScalpelVisual command. Now it replaces all instances of selected sequence in buffer instead of all instances of word under cursor in selected area.

### Acknowledgements
Thanks to Greg Hurrell and his [scalpel](https://github.com/wincent/scalpel) plugin.
